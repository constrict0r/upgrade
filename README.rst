Description
***********

Ansible role to apply a system upgrade.

This role performs the following actions:

* Ensure the requirements are installed.

* Ensure the current user can obtain administrative (root)
   permissions.

* Update the apt cache.

* If the **upgrade** variable is set to *true* or if the
   **configuration** file contains a variable **upgrade** setted to
   *true*, perform a full system upgrade.



Usage
*****

* To install and execute:

..

   ::

      ansible-galaxy install constrict0r.upgrade
      ansible localhost -m include_role -a name=constrict0r.upgrade -K

* Passing variables:

..

   ::

      ansible localhost -m include_role -a name=constrict0r.upgrade -K \
          -e "upgrade: false"

* To include the role on a playbook:

..

   ::

      - hosts: servers
        roles:
            - {role: constrict0r.upgrade}

* To include the role as dependency on another role:

..

   ::

      dependencies:
        - role: constrict0r.upgrade
          upgrade: true

* To use the role from tasks:

..

   ::

      - name: Execute role task.
        import_role:
          name: constrict0r.upgrade
        vars:
          upgrade: true

To run tests:

::

   cd upgrade
   chmod +x testme.sh
   ./testme.sh

On some tests you may need to use *sudo* to succeed.



Variables
*********

The following variables are supported:


upgrade
=======

Boolean variable that defines if a system full upgrade is performed or
not.

If set to *true* a full system upgrade is executed.

This variable is set to *true* by default.

::

   # Including from terminal.
   ansible localhost -m include_role -a name=constrict0r.upgrade -K -e \
       "upgrade=false"

   # Including on a playbook.
   - hosts: servers
     roles:
       - role: constrict0r.upgrade
         upgrade: false

   # To a playbook from terminal.
   ansible-playbook -i tests/inventory tests/test-playbook.yml -K -e \
       "upgrade=false"


configuration
=============

Absolute file path or URL to a *.yml* file that contains all or some
of the variables supported by this role.

It is recommended to use a *.yml* or *.yaml* extension for the
**configuration** file.

This variable is empty by default.

::

   # Using file path.
   ansible localhost -m include_role -a name=constrict0r.upgrade -K -e \
       "configuration=/home/username/my-config.yml"

   # Using URL.
   ansible localhost -m include_role -a name=constrict0r.upgrade -K -e \
       "configuration=https://my-url/my-config.yml"

To see how to write  a configuration file see the *YAML* file format
section.



YAML
****

When passing configuration files to this role as parameters, itâ€™s
recommended to add a *.yml* or *.yaml* extension to the each file.

It is also recommended to add three dashes at the top of each file:

::

   ---

You can include in the file the variables required for your tasks:

::

   ---
   upgrade:
     - true

If you want this role to load list of items from files and URLs you
can set the **expand** variable to *true*:

::

   ---
   upgrade: /home/username/my-config.yml

   expand: true

If the expand variable is *false*, any file path or URL found will be
treated like plain text.
